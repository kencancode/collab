## Collab

Together with my two other team members, we created Collab - a web application allowing social media influencers to connect and collaborate with photographers. Influencers can upload a photo they have in mind, and Collab will return a list of photographers whose portfolio has similar content using an image analysis technology. This project was completed within 10 days.

For this project, I was responsible for the front-end, including React, React Router, React-Bootstrap and UI design.

## Technologies
